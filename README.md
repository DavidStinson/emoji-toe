## Known Issues ðŸ’£

- The foot emoji ðŸ¦¶ (U+1F9B6) requires Unicode/Emoji 11.0, released in 2018. Browsers/OSs that lack support will instead display a missing emoji symbol such as ï¿½ (U+FFFD) in its place. Technically the game would still be playable under this condition, as long as user is on a device that supports any emoji display, as ðŸ‘‹ (U+1F44B) is part of Unicode 6.0 released in 2010
- The prefers-color-scheme media query is a relatively new and may not be widely supported, however if used on an unsupported browser none of the functionality of the page will be impacted.
