# emoji-toe

Welcome to my first project at General Assembly: Emoji-toe, a re-creation of tic-tac-toe using emoji. The Must-Have objectives below were the minimum requirements for completing the project, while other project goals were either instructor suggestions or personal goals. Checked items are fulfilled and completed in the project, while unchecked items have yet to be implemented. Thanks for taking the time to check this out ðŸ¤©!

## Known Issues ðŸ’£

- The foot emoji ðŸ¦¶ (U+1F9B6) requires Unicode/Emoji 11.0, released in 2018. Browsers/OSs that lack support will instead display a missing emoji symbol such as ï¿½ (U+FFFD) in its place. Technically the game would still be playable under this condition, as long as user is on a device that supports any emoji display, as ðŸ‘‹ (U+1F44B) is part of Unicode 6.0 released in 2010
- The prefers-color-scheme media query is a relatively new and may not be widely supported, this does not break any functionality of the page.
